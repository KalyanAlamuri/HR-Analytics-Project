# Employees Presence Insights-Dashboard

## Problem Statement

This dashboard helps the organisations understand their employees better. It helps the organisations know if their employees are satisfied with their work. Through different ratings, they get to know their improvement area, & thus they can improve their work by identifying these area. It also lets them know when specific employee is taking leave,WFH,SL,WO,P etc, thus since by using this dashboard they have identified this problem, they can further work on factors responsible for these unwanted leaves.

Since, number of neutral/dissatisfied employees are more than satisfied employees.


### Steps followed 

- Step 1 : Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a excel file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor & then April, May, June sets are available for data cleaning if any data types messed up, remane column names, unpivoting other columns, removing errors, first row can be used as headers, remove other columns because data is all there in one column.
- Step 3 : Under home tab, Manage Parameters was selected and as new, then name is given to parameter, type and current value is also given which is Apr 2022.
- Step 4 : Selected filter rows based on the worksheet parameter.
- Step 5 : Under Add column tab, Invoke custom column (Activated) was selected where column name and gata data from the source and expanded the data through filters and which columns are necessary that were kept and close and diabled the data which is unwanted and loaded only one cleaned data namely "Final data". 
- Step 6 : Clicked on close and apply to Power BI desktop.

## DAX expressions
- Step 7 : For keeping measures in one table, created a table by selecting enter data under home tab namely "Measure Table".

for creating new measure following DAX expression was written;

           Total Working Days = 

           VAR totaldays = COUNT('Final Data'[Value])

           VAR nonworkdays = CALCULATE(COUNT('Final Data'[Value]),'Final Data'[Value] in {"WO","HO"})

           RETURN
           totaldays-nonworkdays

- Step 8 : Total Working Days are dragged to middle by using card visual.

for creating another measure;

           Present Days = 

           VAR Presentdays = CALCULATE(COUNT('Final Data'[Value]),'Final Data'[Value] = "P")

           RETURN
           Presentdays + [WFH Count]

- Step 9 : Present Days were dragged.

for creating new column following DAX expression was written;

           WFH Count= 

           SWITCH(TRUE(),'Final Data'[Value] = "WFH",1,

          'Final Data'[Value] = "HWFH",0.5,0)

for creating measure following DAX was written;

           WFH Count = 

           SUM('Final Data'[WFH Count])

           SL Count = 
           
           SUM('Final Data'[SL Count])
for Creating measure following DAX was written;

           Presence % = 

           DIVIDE([Present Days],'Measure Table'[Total Working Days],0)

for creating column in Final data following DAX expression was written;

           Month = 

           STARTOFMONTH('Final Data'[Date])

for creating measure DAX expression was written;

           WFH % = 

           DIVIDE([WFH Count],[Present Days],0)

           SL % = 

           DIVIDE([SL Count],[Present Days],0)
           
- Step 10 : DAX for Total Working days, Present Days, WFH count column, WFH & SL measure,WFH% & SL%, Presence%, Month column were created where slicer for April, May, June can be dragged with this Month column.


## Dashboard builting

for good understanding, opted only few values namely WFH%, SL% and Presence% for Visualization purpose, It will look more interesting with this.


- Step 11 : Presence%, WFH%, SL% were dragged and slicer (April, May, June) is activated in tiles mode, click on any of the month then it will show effect on the cards which are dragged and dropped.
- Step 12 : In our Dashboard, using Textbox "Presence Insights" title is given as it shows us attendance % of employees.
- Step 13 : In the report view, line charts are added with different color palletes information of presence%, WFH%, SL% by date with the same table information is there beside line chart visual.
- Step 14 : When we click on any of the specific persons or any months data, it will show effect on the entire report view present.
- Step 15 : With this insights, we can come to conclusion that how much % employees prefers WFH on what days and How much % employees presence will be there in office on what days.
 
 Thus, no. of employees presence is on "Monday" i.e 93.21%
       no. of employees WFH is on "Friday" i.e 13.01%
